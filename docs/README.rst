Olympus Documentation
=====================

To build the documentation you will need to have the following packages installed: ``sphinx``, ``sphinx_rtd_theme``,
``msmb_theme``. You can install them all via ``pip``. You can also do this as follows::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

After this step you can generate the HTML documentation with::

    make html

You can then open the file ``build/html/index.html`` to read the docs.
