Photobleaching WF3
==================


This dataset reports the degradation of polymer blends for organic solar cells
under the exposure to light. Individual data points encode the ratios of
individual polymers in one blend, along with the measured photodegradation of
this blend. [#f1]_

The dataset includes 1,040 samples with four parameters and one objective.
