Colors Bob
==========

This dataset consists of colors prepared by mixing varying amounts of 5 colored dyes (red, orange, yellow, blue, green).
The parameters represent fractions of each dye used in a mixture. The target is the normalized green-like RGB value
[0.16, 0.56, 0.28]. Experiments are performed using the Bayesian Optimized Bartender (BOB). [#f1]_

The dataset includes 241 samples with four parameters and one objective.
