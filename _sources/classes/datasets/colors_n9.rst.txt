Colors N9
=========

This dataset consists of colors prepared by mixing varying amounts of 3 colored dyes (red, green, blue).
The parameters represent fractions of each dye used in a mixture. The target is the normalized green-like RGB value
[0.16, 0.56, 0.28]. This dataset was collected with an N9 robotic arm from North Robotics. [#f1]_

The dataset includes 102 samples with four parameters and one objective.
